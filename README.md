## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
- did a lot of research on the documentation of the utilized methods (reduced, filter) and often took a while to completely understand
- working within prewritten code (i.e understanding structure of HTML and the prewritten classes/id's assigned to elements)
- general debugging of careless but sometimes hard to spot mistakes (naming the wrong property of a game object, forgetting to append elements to document)
